# Python - Inheritance

## Description
> This repository contains scripts that are created as part of the learning objectives of programming at ALX SE programme. The emphasis is on enforcing problem solving skills through programming and other technologies. The `.py` files created are for a deeper understanding of inheritance in Python.

## Learning Objectives
- Why Python programming is awesome
- What is a superclass, baseclass or parentclass
- What is a subclass
- How to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance
- When can an instance have new attributes
- How to inherit class from another
- How to define a class with multiple base classes
- What is the default class every class inherit from
- How to override a method or attribute inherited from the base class
- Which attributes or methods are available by heritage to subclasses
- What is the purpose of inheritance
- What are, when and how to use `isinstance`, `issubclass`, `type` and `super` built-in functions

## Requirements

### General
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs`
- All files should end with a new line
- Operating system: `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`
- The length of all files will be tested using `wc`

### Python Scripts
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- All files must be executables

### Python Test Cases
- All test files should be inside a folder `tests`
- All test files should be text files (extension: `.txt`)
- All tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
- All modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- All functions should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`)
