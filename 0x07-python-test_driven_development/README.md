# Python - Test Driven Development (TDD)

## Description
> This repository contains small projects developed to build knowledge on test driven development using Python. Every code is worth testing as users of any application are well going to be exposing the software's vulnarabilites and such test should be kept before any release of code for deployment.

## Requirements
- OS: `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`
- Language(s): `Python 3.x`
- Editors allowed: `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs`.
- The first line of every code should contain the line: `#!/usr/bin/python3` for intepreting purposes across systems.
- For testing, `pycodestyle` can be used (version: 2.8 or higher).
- Files created must all be executables.
