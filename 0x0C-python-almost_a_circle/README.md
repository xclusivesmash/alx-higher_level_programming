# Python - Almost a circle

## Description
> This repository contains scripts that are created as part of the learning objectives of programming at ALX SE programme. The emphasis is on enforcing problem solving skills through programming and other technologies. The `.py` files created are for a deeper understanding of everything learnt in Python thus far.

## Learning Objectives
- What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
- How to serialize and deserialize a Class
- How to write and read a JSON file
- What is `*args` and how to use it
- What is `**kwargs` and how to use it
- How to handle named arguments in a function

## Requirements

### General
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs`
- All files should end with a new line
- Operating system: `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`
- The length of all files will be tested using `wc`

### Python Scripts
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- All files must be executables
- All modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- All functions should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`)

### Python Test Cases
- All test files should be inside a folder `tests`
- You have to use the `unittest module`
- All your test files should be python files (extension: `.py`)
- All your test files and folders should start with `test_`
- Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project: ex: for `models/base.py`, unit tests must be in: `tests/test_models/test_base.py`
- All your tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m unittest discover tests`
- You can also test file by file by using this command: `python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base.py`
