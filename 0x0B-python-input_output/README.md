# Python - Input/Output

## Description
> This repository contains scripts that are created as part of the learning objectives of programming at ALX SE programme. The emphasis is on enforcing problem solving skills through programming and other technologies. The `.py` files created are for a deeper understanding of I/O in Python.

## Learning Objectives
- Why Python programming is awesome
- How to open a file
- How to write text in a file
- How to read the full content of a file
- How to read a file line by line
- How to move the cursor in a file
- How to make sure a file is closed after using it
- What is and how to use the `with` statement
- What is `JSON`
- What is serialization
- What is deserialization
- How to convert a Python data structure to a JSON string
- How to convert a JSON string to a Python data structure

## Requirements

### General
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs`
- All files should end with a new line
- Operating system: `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`
- The length of all files will be tested using `wc`

### Python Scripts
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- All files must be executables

### Python Test Cases
- All test files should be inside a folder `tests`
- All test files should be text files (extension: `.txt`)
- All tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
- All modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- All functions should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`)
